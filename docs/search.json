    "text": "Phuong (Flora) Le | 2021 - current | PhD\nFlora Le completed her Bachelor of Arts (with Honours) in Psychology at Monash University in 2020. Her Honours project used a novel compositional data analysis approach to investigate the associations between daily activities and affect. Flora commenced her PhD in 2021 and is under the supervision of Dr Joshua Wiley, Dr Dot Dummuid (University of South Australia) and Dr Yue Liao (University of Texas at Arlington).\nHer current research seeks to identify the healthiest way to spend time across daily activities such as sleep and physical activity. Because our day is limited to 24 hours, her work involves developing novel analytical models that explore the effects of balancing activities on daily psychological experiences (e.g., stress and affect) and mental health (e.g., depression and anxiety). She also works as a research assistant across the theme of sleep health, including interventions for better sleep.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Matthews | 2022 - current | PhD (Clinical)\nElizabeth Matthews completed her Bachelor of Biomedical Science in 2017 before completed her Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Psychology in 2020. Her honours project focused on the lived experience of returning to work post-treatment for patients with head and neck cancer. She commenced her PhD in Clinical Psychology at Monash University in 2022 and is supervised by Dr Joshua Wiley, Dr Kate Webber (Oncology, Monash Health) and Dr Catriona Parker (School of Clinical Sciences, Monash Health). Elizabeth’s research is focused on psychological distress management of patients being treated in chemotherapy day units.\n\n\n\nTingyue Sun | 2022 - current | PhD\nTingyue Sun completed her Bachelor of Science (with Honours) in Psychology at the Australian National University in 2021. She commenced her PhD in 2022 and is under the supervision of Dr Joshua Wiley, Dr Julia Stone and Prof Shanthakumar Wilson Rajaratnam. Her current research interests include investigating the predictive effects of daily affect on mental health and academic performance in young people. She is also one of the PhD student researchers of the Circadian, Light, Adolescence, Sleep, and School (CLASS) study.\n\n\n\nTania Wallace | 2023 - current | PhD (Clinical)\nTania Wallace had a previous career in Human Resources in Melbourne and London, before completing the Graduate Diploma in Psychology at Monash University in 2021 and then Bachelor of Science (Honours) at Monash University in 2022. Tania commenced her PhD in clinical psychology at Monash University in 2023 and is supervised by Dr Joshua Wiley and Dr Maria Ftanou, Director of Psychosocial Oncology at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Her research is focused on psychological distress incorporating depression, anxiety and emotional well-being in haematological (blood) cancer patients.\n\n\nGroup Photo - 2022\n\n\n\nGroup Photo - 2021\n\n\n\nGroup Photo - 2020\n\n\n\nGroup Photo - 2019"

    "text": "Through our research, we strive to understand the connections between sleep (behaviour), psychosocial factors, and health. Reflecting our belief that both mental and physical health are important and interconnected, many of our research projects integrate mental and physical health.\nTopics our team has expertise in include sleep and insomnia, emotion regulation, depression and anxiety, and cancer.\nMethods our team has expertise in include clinical trials, ecological momentary assessment, actigraphy, digitomics1, and statistics.\nWe leverage the latest science from our team and others to evaluate and optimise interventions to improve sleep, reduce insomnia symptoms, and promote mental health, particularly in people who are or have been treated for cancer or are experiencing other sources of high stress.\nOur team is led by Dr. Joshua Wiley and is situated within the Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health (Turner) within the Sleep and Circadian Rhythms Program. To see an example of the sort of work we do and how we work to feed findings back to our participants and the community, take a look at our projects and look at some of the reports we have sent our participants there.\nThe word cloud below provides a data-driven summary of the type of work our lab conducts. The word cloud is based off papers published from our lab. Word size shows how commonly specific words appear in our work."

    "text": "Joshua F. Wiley\nDr. Joshua Wiley is a behavioural medicine researcher at Monash University in the School of Psychological Sciences and Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health and Honorary Reserach Fellow at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. He studied health psychology and behavioural medicine, completing his PhD at the University of California at Los Angeles in 2015 with subsequent training in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in his postdoc.\nDr. Wiley’s research includes basic science and applied intervention work. In basic science, his work focuses on understanding the daily and longitudinal dynamics of sleep, psychosocial factors and health, emphasising potentially malleable mechanisms driving poor sleep and health. His intervention work targets the basic science mechanisms identified to attempt to improve sleep and mental health. His intervention research focuses on accessible and feasible sleep/behavioural and emotion regulation interventions with potential for broad dissemination. Aligned with recent calls for personalised medicine, his group combines digitomics and cutting edge data analytics to drive personalised predictions and recommendations to help optimise the content, targetting, and delivery of their interventions. New tools and data analytic pipelines developed for his projects are routinely shared freely and have been picked up in many other studies and projects.\nReflecting the global reach of his research, Dr. Wiley has helped obtain competitive federal grant funding from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Australian Research Council (ARC), United States National Institutes of Health (US NIH), United States Department of Defense (US DoD), and UK Wellcome Trust, totaling &gt;$10 million in funding. He has &gt;100 publications and &gt;8,000 citations (GS).\n\n Connect\n\n github -  Google Scholar\n linkedin -  twitter\n joshua.wiley at monash dot edu"

    "text": "The well-being and health of each member of our team and of the people who participate with us in our work, whether colleagues, study participants or consumer and community partners and advisors, is our first priority.\nWe are committed to creating an environment for work and study that is ethical, inclusive, and supportive. All of us are responsible for upholding these cores values, constantly mindful of them, being accountable for our actions and decisions, and speaking up about any actions or decisions contrary to these values.\nOne concrete step we take to ensure we uphold these values is fostering transparency and open, safe, communication across all team members.\n\nEthics\nWe strive to follow the highest ethical standards in our work, research, and interactions. This includes practicing honesty, fairness, and respect for each person regardless of their status or role.\nWe believe in integrity and professionalism in our research. Our research ethics apply not only to ensuring the safety and well-being of everyone who participates in our research, but also that we are careful, honest, and transparent in our interpretation of results and any outputs we submit.\nIn addition to following standard research ethics rules and principles, as part of enacting these values, we strive towards a number of concrete research ideals:\n\nSharing data, code and materials publicly where possible. This helps ensure that the community’s contribution by volunteering to participate in research provides the most benefit and value to the world.\nProviding people who participate in our research with their own data in a useful format and a summary of our findings. This helps ensure that people who volunteer in our research get the most direct benefit. It also helps provide transparency about how their data are used opening the possibility for open dialogue where concerns may arise.\nEnsuring high standards for data privacy and strict data security as we often collect highly personal and large amounts of data from daily life.\nSeeking diversity and inclusivity in all areas of people who participate in research and in our research team and collaborators.\n\nCarefully considering the nature of data used to build models and algorithms, potential (mis)uses of the algorithms and tools we build, as well as careful application of any existing algorithms or tools in our research. We are particularly mindful about the diversity and inclusivity of the data on which algorithms or models were built. This is important as models/algorithms trained on biased samples can “learn” this bias and then create or perpetuate systematic bias or discrimination in the future.\n\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe are strongly committed to supporting diversity in all areas including but not limited to socioeconomic background, race/ethnicity, culture, religion, language, ability status, and the intersection of multiple, underserved identities.\nWe particularly encourage people who are historically underpresented in the health sciences to apply and join our group. If you are from an underpresented group and would like to join our team, please reach out to the lab head:  joshua.wiley at monash dot edu. Dr. Wiley will be happy to discuss opportunities with you and to discuss any barriers or challenges you may be facing in getting research opportunities due to your background and collaboratively seek ways to resolve them.\n\n\nSupport\nWe are committed to a work environment that is supportive and collegial, and we strongly discourage competition or comparisons between team members. Each person in our team is valued and plays an important role. Achieving milestones and accomplishing tasks on time is important, however, we recognise and value the mental and physical well-being of our team more than outcomes.\nWe encourage self-care and regular,open discussions around self-care needs. This applies to all team members. This may mean getting someone to help cover a shift, adjusting deadlines or scaling back a project. We are committed to finding a path forward and finding additional resources where needed to make sure that everyone on our team is supported and able to maintain their well being as they work and study. These conversations can be difficult, but we believe it is more important to change goals on a project and have a happy, thriving team.\nAs a lab that studies physical and mental health, we recognise that everyone is impacted by their health and foster stigma free communication about staff mental and physical health."

    "text": "Trials\n\nSleepCare | 2020 - current |\n\nThe Sleep, Cancer and Rest (SleepCaRe) Trial is as a parallel group, randomised controled efficacy trial to evaluate individual and combined interventions for sleep and fatigue during chemotherapy. Individuals undergoing chemotherapy are placed at an increased risk of sleep-related disturbance and daytime fatigue. Despite this, sleep concerns among individuals with cancer are often unrecognised and inadequately managed. The SleepCare Trial aims to evaluate interventions to address this gap. Project findings will inform the feasibility and utility of cost-effective interventions for sustainable integration within routine oncology care. The SleepCaRe Trial is a being conducted as part of a collaboration between Monash University, the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Monash Health, Bendigo Health, Ballarat Health, and the Mater Hospital Sydney.   Find out more at the study website.   For questions or other information, email: psych.sleepcare@monash.edu.  This clinical trial is registered ACTRN12620001133921 with ethics approved by the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre.\n\n\nCanCope | 2020 - 2022 |\n\nThe CanCope Study is an online trial aiming to help people who have had cancer cope with difficult emotions they may experience and improve mental health outcomes. Many people affected by cancer continue to experience distressing emotions after treatment has finished. The CanCope Trial is an emotion-focused, transdiagnostic intervention which explores the mechanisms underlying changes in emotion regulation, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. The CanCope Study has been develped and each module individually piloted. We are now preparing for a randomised, controlled efficacy trial.  CanCope is currently recruiting and taking expressions of interest.  Find out more at the study website.   For questions or other information, email: psych.cancope@monash.edu or call/text: +61 404353956.  This clinical trial is registered ACTRN12620000943943p with ethics approved by Monash University.\n\n\nSleepWell | 2018 - 2020 |\n\nThe SleepWell Trial is a randomized controlled trial designed to test interventions we hope may be effective at improving sleep and reducing fatigue in women with breast cancer while being feasible for wide spread dissemination. Women with breast cancer commonly report sleep disruptions and fatigue, particularly during chemotherapy. SleepWell represents a first step in addressing this need. SleepWell was conducted as a collaboration between Monash University and the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre with recruitment and intervention occurring at the Peter MacCallum Caner Centre. SleepWell was led and conducted by Ms. Helena Bean as part of her doctorate. SleepWell was completed in 2020.   For more info, read the Explanatory Statement.   This clinical trial is registered ACTRN12618001255279.  For questions or other information, email: joshua.wiley@monash.edu."

The study will incorporate both the patient and healthcare professional perspectives to explore satisfaction with current practice and how an ideal strategy may differ. Distress levels and preferences for distress management will also be compared across high vs low distress patients and across different demographics. Surveys, focus group and one-on-one interviewing will all be used to explore the aims of the study.\n\n\nTCSupport | 2021 - 2023 |\n\nTCSupport is a mixed-method project aiming to understand the relationship between testicular cancer (TC) and masculinity in men in Australia. Despite high survival rate (~98%) research has indicated TC is associated with psychological distress including fear of cancer recurrence, depression and anxiety. TCSupport aims to understand whether self-perception of masculinity is associated with these types of distress and guide future interventions for supporting men with TC.

During this time, they face many changes: new independence from family, moving and living in a new city, and new courses and studies. All these changes can cause stress. The purpose of this study is to understand how young adults respond to stress during these transitions and what helps people manage stress. The Stress and Health Study focused on how family experiences, resilience, behaviours (diet, exercise, sleep), and coping strategies relate to stress and how people feel. The findings of this study will help us better understand stress and responses to stress, which we hope can help us develop interventions to help people manage stress effectively.

Although multiple evidence-based interventions exist for both sleep and depression, up to 50% of people do not respond to first line treatments. Symptom burden can be reduced by optimising treatment selection, yet traditional, theoretically-driven efforts at determining who will benefit most from a given treatment have yielded few results.  My research proposes to use machine learning on existing treatment trials to build algorithms that use individuals’ characteristics to generate personalised predictions for which of multiple evidence-based treatments is most likely to result in the largest symptom reductions. Where gaps emerge in existing trials for building treatment selection algorithms, over the next five years, my group also will conduct new, brief sleep and depression trials in cancer to fill these gaps and enhance and validate algorithms developed on existing datasets. My dual background in behavioural medicine and advanced quantitative methods along, a team of five PhD students, and research positions at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre make me ideally positioned to conduct this research.  Optimal matching of individuals to treatments can improve outcomes by reducing the time it takes to find a treatment that works for an individual. This is particularly significant in the context of cancer where patients have limited energy to engage in treatments and the growing number of cancer patients and survivors tax limited health care resources. Models and algorithms developed during this fellowship will be disseminated to stakeholders by deploying them through freely available, easy to use online web applications.\n\n\nProjects We Collaborate On\n\n\nREPAT | 2019 - 2022 |\n\nApproximately one-third of women coping with breast cancer experience persistent symptoms of depression, pain and fatigue, which are not normative and are difficult to treat. Emotional approach coping and expression of emotion is related to fewer and faster recovery from depression symptoms. However, expression of emotion is inconsistent with social norms in some cultures. Using visual art-making as a form of expression and communication within a safe and supportive relationship may be an effective way for women from cultures where emotion expression is not normative to approach, process and express their emotions. The Role of Emotional Processing in Art Therapy (REPAT) for breast cancer palliative care patients study is a randomized controlled trial being lead by the University of Haifa in Israel. REPAT evaluates the impact of art making in women who have completed primary treatment for breast cancer. REPAT also has a focus on mechanisms including detailed assessments of emotion-regulation and physiological (e.g., cholinergic, anti-inflammatory processes) mechanisms that may underpin the link between art making and improvements in outcomes. REPAT also is unique in explicitly recruiting both Jewish and Arab women allowing a comparison of cultural differences and comparison of more traditional and collectivist ethno-cultures.

The goal is to provide the public a voice through the collection and dissemination of findings that help shape the design and delivery of targeted communication and intervention strategies to improve public health efforts and save lives.  The Behavioral Medicine Lab is a collaborator on some of the COPE projects.

Yet, the extent to which the biological clock in the brain plays a role in cognitive function and academic functioning is currently not understood. The Circadian, Light, Adolescence, Sleep, and School (CLASS) study is a longitudinal, cohort study lead by Monash University and PI A/Prof. Bei. CLASS uses state-of-the-art measures of the biological clock, rigorous assessment of light exposure and sophisticated analytical approaches. CLASS will demonstrate longitudinal relationships between environmental light exposure, multiple facets of sleep-wakefulness, and ecologically relevant measures of academic achievement and depression. The proposed study will identify specific sleep and circadian markers that are linked to academic performance, and generate innovative algorithms that predict these associations. Findings from CLASS can help drive prevention and early intervention programs that use sleep-wake and light exposure information to improve sleep quality. CLASS has been funded by the ARC and NHMRC to allow further longitudinal follow-up.  For more info, see the CLASS Website.

However, relatively little is known about the daily dynamics of sleep and other psychosocial factors, such as affect or cognitive performance, during these periods. The Study of Teenage Emotions, Performance and Sleep (STEPS) aimed to address this gap by measuring daily sleep, performance, and affect across two weeks of school term and two weeks of school holidays in Australian adolescents in Years 11 or 12. STEPS was lead by Lin Shen as part of her PhD.\n\n\nCan-Sleep | 2017 - current |\n\nCan-Sleep is a series of projects covering adults after cancer, adolescents and young adults after cancer, and more, including work to bring Can-Sleep to Vietnamese speaking people after cancer and to ovarian cancer. Can-Sleep is led by the Psyhosocial Oncology Program at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and more information can be found here.\n\n\nMYA | 2014 - 2020 |\n\nThe My Year After (MYA) study is a longitudinal, cohort study of 460 women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. Women in the study were followed from shortly after breast cancer diagnosis (on average 2.1 months after diagnosis) for 12 months. The study was focused on identifying changes in depression symptoms over time and predictors of these different responses. While we continue work to identify risk and protective factors, we are actively leveraging what we have learned to build new interventions designed to reduce and prevent depression."
